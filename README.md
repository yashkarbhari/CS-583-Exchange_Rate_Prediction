# Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction

### Abstract
This project describes in detail the methodologies and technologies used in the final project for course CS 583: Deep Learning conducted under the guidance of Professor Jia Xu and Dr. Abdul Khan. The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust deep-learning model capable of accurately predicting Foreign Exchange Rates (Indian Rupees) - a challenging task within the realm of time series analysis. A key focus of the experimentation was the evaluation of various transfer learning techniques and their impact on the overall performance of the models. The project involved creating and comparing several RNN and LSTM-based regressor models that are Fine-tuned on Indiaâ€™s Forex data. Performance assessments were conducted using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared. Furthermore, the project investigates hyperparameter tuning to optimize the best-performing model to enhance its predictive capabilities. 

### Introduction

The Foreign Exchange Rate, or forex rate, represents the relative value of one currency compared to another and is crucial for international trade and financial transactions. Predicting forex rates poses a significant challenge due to the complex and dynamic nature of the factors influencing currency fluctuations. Multiple variables, such as geopolitical events, economic indicators, and market sentiment, contribute to the volatility of exchange rates. Additionally, the interconnectivity of global markets and the presence of intricate patterns in time series data make it challenging to capture and model accurately. 
Moreover, time series data presents its unique set of challenges stemming from temporal dependencies, non-stationarity, seasonality, trends, noise, complex patterns, limited historical information, and the dynamic influence of external factors. Addressing these intricacies calls for specialized models such as RNN and LSTM, designed to account for the sequential nature of input data.

In addition to the primary goal of constructing an accurate prediction model, this project undertakes a comparative analysis of various transfer learning techniques to identify the most effective one. The methodologies encompass the creation of a pre-trained model using 3 different types of dataset formats (Explained in detail in the method section) which incorporate data from multiple countries. Subsequently, we fine-tune the models with India's economic indicators and Forex data. The refined models are then applied to predict future Forex rates, incorporating a specified 30-day lag time to forecast the rate for the 31st day.

Ultimately, the best-performing model (LSTM), underwent a crucial refinement through hyperparameter tuning during the fine-tuning phase. In this process, the foundational layers of the pre-tuned model remained fixed, while the subsequent layers which were being fine-tuned with Indian Forex data underwent optimization. Parameters such as activation functions, node counts in each layer, and the final optimizer function were meticulously selected using the Keras-tuner library. This meticulous approach resulted in the development of a final model that significantly outperformed its counterparts created through manual trial and error. Further details on these steps will be provided in subsequent sections of this report, offering insight into the enhancement achieved through transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning.
