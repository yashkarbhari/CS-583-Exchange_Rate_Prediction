# Foreign Exchange Rate Prediction

### Abstract
This project describes in detail the methodologies and technologies used in the final project for course CS 583: Deep Learning conducted under the guidance of Professor Jia Xu and Dr. Abdul Khan. The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust deep-learning model capable of accurately predicting Foreign Exchange Rates (Indian Rupees) - a challenging task within the realm of time series analysis. A key focus of the experimentation was the evaluation of various transfer learning techniques and their impact on the overall performance of the models. The project involved creating and comparing several RNN and LSTM-based regressor models that are Fine-tuned on Indiaâ€™s Forex data. Performance assessments were conducted using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared. Furthermore, the project investigates hyperparameter tuning to optimize the best-performing model to enhance its predictive capabilities.
